# Turntable

This project is a simple website that helps people expand their music taste. This website generates a random song, album, or artist based on their filters. We used extensive CSS methods and JavaScript to make this fully funcitonal. We also used a cool method called "color thief" that finds the major color that appears in the album image.

## About

We created this project to help music goers find new albums to listen to.
This is mainly for anyone looking to expand what their taste in music is.
We think it has easy functionality and is fun for anyone to use.

## Features

- List key features or functionalities
- A filter for the user to be able to filter what era of music or genre to listen to for a song, album or artist
- One thing we found is that we could not implement the year filer for the artist but we think that the filters for the album and songs work proficiently.
